# Cull Less Leaves

Cull Less Leaves skips rendering of inner leaf layers, improving performance.

## Performance

In a worst-case scenario, overlooking a mangrove swamp, this mod can
have up to a _**30% performance increase**_ (measured on low-end hardware).

Instead of leaving just the outer layer of leaves, Cull Less Leaves also renders a certain amount
of layers defined in the config.

**[Works best with Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)**

## Why not just use [Cull Leaves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-leaves)?

Cull Leaves only renders the outermost layer of leaves, which can look
quite ugly (see fast culling in image below), but **Cull Leaves improves
performance more than Cull Less Leaves**.
